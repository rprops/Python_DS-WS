# Python workshop notes

# Day 1
## Introduction session  

* Need to make environment using yml and then activate this environment
* PyCharm/Eclipse as alternatives to RStudio

NOTE: When you're stuck, or things do crash:
first try **Kernel** > **Interrupt** -> your cell should stop running
if no succes -> **Kernel** > **Restart** -> restart your notebook

Magic commands can not simply be followed my comments on same line.

`%whos gets list of environment (like in R Environment)`
