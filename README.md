# Python workshop notes

# Day 1
## Introduction session  

* Need to make environment using yml and then activate this environment
* PyCharm/Eclipse as alternatives to RStudio

NOTE: When you're stuck, or things do crash:
first try **Kernel** > **Interrupt** -> your cell should stop running
if no succes -> **Kernel** > **Restart** -> restart your notebook

Magic commands can not simply be followed my comments on same line.

`%whos gets list of environment (like in R Environment)`

Variable assignment for two variable simultaneously:  
`name, age = 'John', 30`

This import method will define the packages based on their acronym (community consensus):  
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

* Functions with same name specify using the package name (like in R):
For example:  
np.sum (np::sum like it would be in R)
instead of 
sum (also base python function)

* Means go back from the end instead of removing position -2 from the vector as in R:  
a_list[-2]

* True instead of TRUE in python vs R
